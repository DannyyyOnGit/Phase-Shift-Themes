Troubleshooting
===============

If you experience trouble running open3mod from open3mod.exe, try
installing the following components  from Microsoft:

- Visual C++ Redistributable für Visual Studio 2012 Update 4
  http://www.microsoft.com/de-de/download/details.aspx?id=30679

- .NET 4.5 Framework
  http://www.microsoft.com/de-de/download/details.aspx?id=30653

Also try updating your graphics drivers (from NVIDIA, AMD, ..). Consider 
this in particular if one of the following occurs:

- 3D view remains black
- open3mod window appears, but crashes upon loading a 3D model.


If your troubles persist, post an issue on Github:
