## Q&A
<i><b>When are you going to finish this theme?</b></i><br>
I'm doing this for the first time and still getting used to it. It really depends on how much time I'm willing to invest in this voluntary project. Any contributions will speed up this process. <br><br> To give a simple answer: expect at least 1 month.
<br><br><i><b>Will the theme ports be 1:1 accurate to the old ones?</b></i><br>
No! I'm keeping the most of the structure but expect several changes, especially to asset quality.
<br><br><i><b>How can I contribute?</b></i><br>
Contributions can be direct modifcations using <a href="https://github.com/TheRealDannyyy/Phase-Shift-Theme-Ports/pulls">pull requests</a>. Users can also contribute by <a href="https://github.com/TheRealDannyyy/Phase-Shift-Theme-Ports/issues">reporting bugs</a>.
<br><br><i><b>How can I follow the progress of this project?</b></i><br>
Currently the only way is to watch and star the project (requires account). <br>Once things are stable, I will create a Steam forum topic.
