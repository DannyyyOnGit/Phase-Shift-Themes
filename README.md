## Q&A
<i><b>When are you going to finish this project?</b></i><br>
It really depends on how much time I'm willing to invest in this project. Any contributions will speed up this process. <br> To give a simple answer: expect at least 1 month for a single theme port.
<br><br><i><b>How can I contribute?</b></i><br>
Contributions can be direct modifcations using <a href="https://github.com/TheRealDannyyy/Phase-Shift-Theme-Ports/pulls">pull requests</a>. Users can also contribute by <a href="https://github.com/TheRealDannyyy/Phase-Shift-Theme-Ports/issues">reporting bugs</a>.
<br><br><i><b>Will the theme ports be 1:1 accurate?</b></i><br>
No! I'm keeping the most of the structure but expect several changes, especially to asset quality.
<br><br><i><b>How can I follow the progress of this project?</b></i><br>
Currently the only ways to stay in touch are to fork, watch or star the project (requires account). <br>Once things are stable, I will create a Steam forum topic.
